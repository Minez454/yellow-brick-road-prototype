# Yellow Brick Road Platform
**Developed by Unique Pathways (501c3)**

> "Navigating Homelessness, Together."

## 🚀 Project Overview
Yellow Brick Road is a dual-sided digital ecosystem designed to bridge the critical gap between homeless individuals ("Members") and social service providers ("Agents") in Las Vegas. 

Unlike static directories, this platform operates as a **Live Command Center**, providing real-time data on shelter bed availability, food resource status, and case management.

## 🌟 Core Features

### 1. The "Brick" AI Companion
A trauma-informed AI partner that uses **cumulative listening** and **psychometric assessment** to build trust. Brick does not just list resources; it weaves complex needs (e.g., "I have a dog, I am a Veteran, and I have warrants") into a single, cohesive strategy for the user.

### 2. Live Resource Map
A dynamic mapping system utilizing **Leaflet.js** that categorizes resources by type and availability:
* 🔴 **Soup Kitchens:** Immediate hot meals.
* 🔵 **Community Pantries:** Grocery boxes.
* 🟢 **Free Grocery Stores:** Fresh produce markets.
* 🟣 **Food Banks:** Bulk distribution.

### 3. The Academy (School of Life)
A personalized curriculum generator that addresses the **"Survival to Maintenance"** transition.
* **Diagnostic Tree:** Builds a unique lesson plan based on user inputs (e.g., "Do you have a pet?", "Do you cook on an open fire?").
* **Life Skills Modules:** Covers critical gaps often overlooked, such as *Fire Safety for Tents*, *Trench Foot Prevention*, and *Indoor Re-integration Psychology*.
* **Creative Studio:** Built-in art therapy tools for mental health decompression.

### 4. Secure Digital Vault
An encrypted wallet for storing critical identity documents (State IDs, Birth Certificates, Housing Applications), ensuring users never lose progress due to lost physical paperwork.

### 5. Dual-Sided Architecture
The platform features two distinct interfaces:
* **Member Portal:** For individuals seeking aid.
* **Agent Portal:** A "Back Office" for agencies (e.g., The Shade Tree, NPHY) to update bed counts in real-time, manage waitlists, and conduct virtual intakes via Zoom.

## 🛠 Technical Stack
* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3 (Glossy Gold UI), Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Mapping:** Leaflet.js / OpenStreetMap.
* **Architecture:** Single-Page Application (SPA) with state management for user profiles and live data simulation.

## 🔮 Vision
To eliminate the "information gap" in social services by creating a centralized nervous system where data flows instantly between the streets and the shelters, restoring dignity and autonomy to the user.
